# Security Hardening

Follow these recommendations to keep your deployment secure:

- Keep your Go runtime up to date
- Run VeloFlux as a non-root user when possible
- Use HTTPS and enable the built-in WAF
- Restrict access to the admin API with strong credentials
- Regularly rotate JWT secrets and TLS certificates
